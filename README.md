# fractaltree
I have created this small project of the fractal tree and its movement. 
I have designed the fractal tree to have dark purple roots and light purple branches to give a gradient effect. 
I have also designed it so that this application showcasing the movements of the fractal tree can fit to the screen size of the user regardless of screen's size
