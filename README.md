# Fractal Tree
This project shows a fractal tree and its movement
I have designed the fractal tree to have dark purple roots and light purple branches to give a gradient effect. 
I have also designed it so that this application showcasing the movements of the fractal tree can fit to the screen size of the user regardless of screen's size


Below is the video recording how my program executes:
